                <h3>What is Python?</h3>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.
                    <br><br>
                    It is used for:
                </p>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Web development (server-side).</li>
                    <li>Software development.</li>
                    <li>Mathematics,
                    system scripting.</li>
                </ul>
                <br><br>

                <h3>What can Python do?</h3>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Python can be used on a server to create web applications.</li>
                    <li>Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.</li>
                    <li>Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.</li>
                    <li>Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.</li>
                    <li>Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.</li>
                </ul>
    
                <br><br>

                <h3>Why Python?</h3>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).
                    <li>Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.</li>
                    <li>Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.</li>
                    <li>Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.</li>
                    <li>Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way.</li>

            <h2>2. History:</h2>
            <p>
                Python was conceived in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands as a successor to the ABC programming language, which was inspired by SETL, capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system. Its implementation began in December 1989.
                <br><br>
                Van Rossum shouldered sole responsibility for the project, as the lead developer, until 12 July 2018, when he announced his "permanent vacation" from his responsibilities as Python's "benevolent dictator for life", a title the Python community bestowed upon him to reflect his long-term commitment as the project's chief decision-maker.
                <br>
                In January 2019, active Python core developers elected a five-member Steering Council to lead the project.[45][46]
                <br><br>
                Python 2.0 was released on 16 October 2000, with many major new features. Python 3.0, released on 3 December 2008, with many of its major features backported to Python 2.6.x and 2.7.x. Releases of Python 3 include the 2to3 utility, which automates the translation of Python 2 code to Python 3.
                <br><br>
                Python 2.7's end-of-life was initially set for 2015, then postponed to 2020 out of concern that a large body of existing code could not easily be forward-ported to Python 3. No further security patches or other improvements will be released for it. With Python 2's end-of-life, only Python 3.6.x and later were supported. Later, support for 3.6 was also discontinued. In 2021, Python 3.9.2 and 3.8.8 were expedited as all versions of Python (including 2.7) had security issues leading to possible remote code execution and web cache poisoning.
                <br><br>
                In 2022, Python 3.10.4 and 3.9.12 were expedited and so were older releases including 3.8.13, and 3.7.13 because of many security issues in 2022. Python 3.9.13 is the latest 3.9 version, and from now on 3.9 (and older; 3.8 and 3.7) will only get security updates.
